jquery.iconize.js
=================

Iconize is a very lightweight (under 2kb packed or minified) jQuery plugin that adds a content specific icon to each link that matches the selector.

The icon added is based on the remote files extension.

Usage
-----

Couldn't be easier to use...

    $('a').iconize();

Demo

Coming soon
